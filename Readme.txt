 Step 1 change the directory to backend folder and do npm install

 step 2 open a mongo db connection in your localhost  and check my config file in backend/utils/config for port number of mongo db.

 step 3 run node index.js or nodemon index.js 

 The above steps ensure that express server is running on backend


 step 4 change the directory to front end and run a local server in that folder  - I have http-server npm package

 step 5 Now that front end and backend have started drop the buttons from right to left and click on submit button below


 step 6 an alert comes up gives the url of backend

 step 7 open that url and we can see the dropped buttons before in a html page
